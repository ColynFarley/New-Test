#This readme will serve as a response to step 5s questions


I liked the fact that githubs features are for the most part easy to understand and learn. However it can sometimes be difficult to dive into, while its all there and easy to comprehend, the learning curve and finding of such information can take some digging. I would like to see more examples or detailed videos of the features. These videos would certainly be helpful in our learning journey as it would make the intial step into github a little less overwhelming.
